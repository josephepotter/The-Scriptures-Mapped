The experience of completing this project was a little challenging because I had
never done so much with dynamically changing a web page through JavaScript. Once
I started to figure it out, however, it got a lot easier. I started by watching
the videos, but I eventually decided to finish a lot of the foundation of the
project without the videos because I thought that I would learn better by doing
it myself. I also decided to do my own CSS for styling to give myself a bit of
refresher with CSS.  One of the main things that I learned from this project was
how to deal with the inherently asynchronous nature of JavaScript. This project
had a lot going on, and a lot of the errors I had were with trying to move on
from an action before an action it depended on completed.
